## 开篇

最近一次登录公司的开发者账号，提示协议升级了，必须同意之后才能进行证书、发布等工作，于是凑着把他们的协议贴出来，提供需要的开发者参考，因为之前吃过亏，每次更新协议我都不仔细看，往往是这些细节，造成了开发以及发布的时候一些不必要的麻烦，其实苹果已经在每次的改版中公示广大开发者，英语障碍是多少开发者的软肋啊，如果英语无障碍，估计能避免很多问题，希望这篇文章能帮助到 哪怕一个同行，完全是粘贴，有需要的可以自己翻译看看。好了，请看正文……

Your Applications on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Applications developed under this Agreement for iOS Products, Apple Watch, or Apple TV can be

Program area of the App Store, if selected by Apple, (3) on a limited basis for use on Registered

Devices (as defined below), and (4) for beta testing through TestFlight. Applications developed

for macOS can be distributed through the App Store, if selected by Apple, or separately

distributed under this Agreement.

Applications that meet Apple's Documentation and Program Requirements may be submitted for

consideration by Apple for distribution via the App Store, B2B Program, or for beta testing through

TestFlight. If submitted by You and selected by Apple, Your Applications will be digitally signed

by Apple and distributed, as applicable. Distribution of free (no charge) Applications (including

those that use the In-App Purchase API for the delivery of free content) will be subject to the

distribution terms contained in Schedule 1 to this Agreement. If You would like to distribute

Applications for which You will charge a fee or would like to use the In-App Purchase API for the

delivery of fee-based content, You must enter into a separate agreement with Apple (“Schedule

2”). If You would like to distribute Applications via the B2B Program, You must enter into a

request, You will need to submit information about Your requested use of FPS. Apple will review

Your request and reserves the right to not provide You with the FPS Deployment Package at its

sole discretion, in which case You will not be able to deploy FPS. Any development and testing

responsible for storing and protecting them. You may use such FPS keys solely for the purpose

of delivering and protecting Your content key that is used to decrypt video content streamed by

You to Authorized FPS Applications or downloaded for viewing through Your Authorized FPS

Applications. Apple will have no liability or responsibility for unauthorized access to or use of any

FPS key or any content streamed or otherwise delivered under this Agreement in connection with

FPS. In the event that Your FPS key is disclosed, discovered, misappropriated or lost, You may

request that Apple revoke it by emailing product-security@apple.com, and You understand that

Apple will have no obligation to provide a replacement key. Apple reserves the right to revoke

Your FPS key at any time if requested by You, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by You,

if otherwise deemed prudent or reasonable by Apple, or upon expiration or termination of this

Agreement for any reason.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple reserves the right to revoke or otherwise remove Your

access to and use of FPS (or any part thereof) at any time in its sole discretion. Further, Apple

will have no obligation to provide any modified, updated or successor version of the FPS

Deployment Package or the FPS SDK to You and will have no obligation to maintain compatibility

with any prior version. If Apple makes new versions of the FPS Deployment Package or FPS

Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or that infringes any

otherwise agreed by Apple in writing.

You understand there may be storage capacity, transmission, and/or transactional limits for the

Apple Services both for You as a developer and for Your end-users. If You reach or Your end-

have a binding written agreement with Your Service Provider with terms at least as restrictive and
